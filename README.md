# Figma Rust

An exploration of the Figma API and file structure using Rust.

## Initial Project

I will create a command line utility that will take a Figma file and output
design tokens. The output will be interchangeable with the output of the
[design tokens](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens) plugin.
