# Figma REST API Rust Schema

Documented structs to deserialize JSON responses from the
[Figma REST API](https://www.figma.com/developers/api) into.

These definitions are used by the
[parent project](https://github.com/ccouzens/figma-rust) but are distributed
separately as they may be of use to other people.

They may never be feature complete. Instead emphasis is placed on fields and
types that get used by the parent project.

This schema is also used to build
[TypeScript types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figma-rest-api-typescript-definitions),
[Kotlin types](https://github.com/ccouzens/figma-rust/blob/main/definitions.kt)
and
[Swift types](https://github.com/ccouzens/figma-rust/blob/main/definitions.kt).
